## Play

The game is played by moving the princess (player) using the keyboard keys up, down, left and right. The goal of the game is to get from the grass to the water without colliding with the moving enemies (bugs). Each time the princess succeeds in this, she gets 10 points. Every 20 points the level is increased which means that the speed of the enemies will get faster. Each time the princess collides with an enemy, 10 points will be subtracted from her score (and also the level will adjust accordingly if necessary). The game can be played endlessly until the speed is too fast.
